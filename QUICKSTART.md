## 📊 What You'll Build

### Core Project Tables
```
sales_raw              (5M rows, unoptimized baseline)
    ↓
sales_partitioned      (country partitioning)
    ↓  
sales_raw_zorder       (Z-ordered by customer_id, product_id)
    ↓
sales_to_compact       (fragmented for compaction demo)
    ↓
sales_auto_compact     (with auto-optimization enabled)
    ↓
sales_liquid_clustered (adaptive clustering)
```

### Extension Tables (Advanced Path)
```
sales_date_partitioned     (temporal partitioning)
sales_dual_partitioned     (country + date)
optimization_metrics       (performance tracking)
partition_comparison_results (benchmark results)
```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting Quick Reference

### Common Issues

**❌ "Catalog creation failed"**
```
Solution: Use existing catalog in config or check permissions
# In project.ipynb, change:
CATALOG_NAME = "main"  # or your existing catalog
```

**❌ "OPTIMIZE command not found"** 
```
Solution: Ensure you're using Databricks Runtime 11.0+
Check: Cluster → Configuration → Runtime Version
```

**❌ "Slow query performance"**
```
Solutions:
• Use larger cluster (4+ cores recommended)
• Enable Photon acceleration if available
• Check cluster memory settings
```

**❌ "Permission denied errors"**
```
Solutions:
• Ensure workspace permissions for catalog/schema creation
• Try using default catalog: CATALOG_NAME = "main"
• Contact admin for Unity Catalog access
```

## 📈 Performance Expectations

### Typical Execution Times (4-core cluster)
- Data generation: 2-5 minutes
- Each optimization step: 30 seconds - 2 minutes  
- Full main notebook: 15-30 minutes
- Extension notebooks: 10-60 minutes each

### Resource Recommendations
- **Minimum**: 2 cores, 8GB RAM
- **Recommended**: 4+ cores, 16+ GB RAM
- **Advanced**: 8+ cores, 32+ GB RAM (for large extensions)

## 🎓 Next Steps After Completion

### Apply to Your Data
1. Adapt the synthetic data generation for your schema
2. Implement metrics collection for your workloads
3. Use the partitioning comparison framework for your tables

### Production Considerations
1. Start with conservative partition counts (<100 partitions)
2. Monitor file sizes regularly (target 100MB-1GB per file)
3. Set up automated optimization policies
4. Implement proper VACUUM retention policies

### Extended Learning
1. Explore Delta Lake advanced features (CDC, Time Travel)
2. Learn about Unity Catalog governance features
3. Study Photon performance optimization
4. Investigate streaming optimization patterns

## 💡 Pro Tips for Maximum Learning

1. **Always measure**: Use Spark UI to verify optimization impacts
2. **Experiment safely**: All notebooks are idempotent and use isolated tables
3. **Document findings**: The metrics tables persist your experiment results
4. **Compare strategies**: Use the extension notebooks to understand trade-offs
5. **Think production**: Consider how learnings apply to your real workloads
